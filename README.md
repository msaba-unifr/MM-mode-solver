# MM-mode-solver

This program implements the formalism described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09559 as a Julia package. In its current version, the package computes the (evanescent) Floquet eigenmodes of 2D cylinder and 3D sphere packings with one object in the primitive unit cell. The objects can be filled with an arbitrarily dispersive material described by a complex permittivity.
